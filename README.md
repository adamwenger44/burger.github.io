This is an application that allows you to virtually add, and eat burgers.  There are burgers that are there to start out, if the burger is devoured it will be in the section that says, burgers that have been devoured.  If not they will be in the section that says burgers that have not been devoured.  If you would like to eat the burger, just click the button next to the corresponding burger, it will then move the burger to the "burgers that have been devoured" section.  In addition you can add burgers, they will then be there instantly for you to eat if you would like.
